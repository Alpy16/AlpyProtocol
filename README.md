About,


Alpy FundMe is a decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built on Ethereum.
This project was developed as part of the Cyfrin Updraft Solidity and Foundry bootcamp.

Users can fund the contract with ETH, and the contract owner can withdraw accumulated funds.
ETH to USD conversion is powered by Chainlink price feeds.



Features:  
- Fund contract with ETH  
- USD-denominated minimum contribution (5 USD)  
- Restricted withdrawals (only owner)  
- Optimized withdrawal function  
- Deployment to Sepolia testnet  
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests using Foundry  
- Automated deployment and interaction scripts  
- Aligned with modern Solidity best practices  

Quick start guide:

Requirements:  
- Foundry v1.2.3 or newer  
- Alchemy API Key (Sepolia)  
- Ethereum wallet private key with testnet ETH  
- Etherscan API Key  

Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alpy16/Alpy-FundMe-Cyfrin.git
cd Alpy-FundMe-Cyfrin
forge install
```

Environment configuration:  
Create a `.env` file with the following content:
```env
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-alchemy-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-api-key
```

Usage:

Build contracts:
```bash
forge build
```

Run tests:
```bash
forge test
```

Deploy to Sepolia:
```bash
make deploy-sepolia
```

Scripts:

Fund the contract:
```bash
forge script script/Interactions.s.sol:FundFundMe --broadcast --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Withdraw funds:
```bash
forge script script/Interactions.s.sol:WithdrawFundMe --broadcast --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```
